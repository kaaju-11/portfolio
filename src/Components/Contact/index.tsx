                This Blog Website is made with Front-end and Back-end. In this
                website, proper authentication is used. In the front-end, I have
                used React, Redux with TypeScript using different react
                libraries. In the back-end, I have used Nodejs and Express. For
                Database, I used MongoDB which is no-sql database.
